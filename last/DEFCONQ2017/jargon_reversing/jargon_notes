next, try getting syscalls working...


0x84 seems to be div. does  [top of stack]/[next val in stack]. stack is displayed with top at bottom.


0x86

good_syscalls:
'\xb6\xb2\x84\xa0'
'\xb6\xb4\x84\xa0'
'\xb6\xb8\x84\xa0'
'\xb6\xbc\x84\xa0'
but just fills stack with crap


0xd seems to be stack ops like dup, increment, decrement

one allows me to go from the 16 to the 255 set

how to getting all rogues: with 0x18
every output of 0x18 has rogue in front, commutative

0x1* does weird things

0x20 does subtract... 

so, i can 

try to find more syscalls!!!!


\x14 is a div of some sort because of divide by zero... 
takes three operands, all same vals on stack gives hoju


0x6 is multiply!!! that will give me what i want, the ability to test all 256 values for syscall


0xe is a swap...

WHERE IS MY MULTIPLY?

0x8 seems to reverse sign



1 is addition?
2 subtract
3 some sort of multiply 
4 divide? 
5 ?
6 ?
7 ?
8 negate
9 ?? two operands, when first is 0, it crashes
a syscall
b push
c pop a value, do something with it?
d dup
e swap
f pop a value, do something with it?

from testing multiply 0x3: 186 left to test
