# UnCrackable Mobile Apps

<img align="left" width="100px" src="../Document/Images/Other/uncrackable-logo.png">

Welcome to the UnCrackable Apps for Android and iOS, a collection of mobile reverse engineering challenges. These challenges are used as examples throughout the Mobile Security Testing Guide. Of course, you can also solve them for fun. If you do solve any of the challenges, please take a moment to do our brief post-cracking [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2TS2MZJ).

## [Android License Validator](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/Crackmes/Android/License_01/ "Android License Validator")

A brand new Android app sparks your interest. Of course, you are planning to purchase a license for the app eventually, but you'd still appreciate a test run before shelling out $1. Unfortunately no keygen is available!

- Objective: Generate a valid serial key that is accepted by this app.
- Author: [Bernhard Mueller](https://github.com/b-mueller "Bernhard Mueller")
- Maintained by the OWASP MSTG leaders [Jeroen Willemsen](https://github.com/commjoen "Jeroen Willemsen") & [Sven Schleier](https://github.com/sushi2k "Sven Schleier")

### Installation

Copy the binary to your Android device and run using the shell.

```shell
  $ adb push validate /data/local/tmp
  [100%] /data/local/tmp/validate
  $ adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/validate
  $ adb shell /data/local/tmp/validate
  Usage: ./validate <serial>
  $ adb shell /data/local/tmp/validate 1234
  Incorrect serial (wrong format).
```

# iOS

## [UnCrackable App for iOS Level 1](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/Crackmes/iOS/Level_01/ "iOS level 1")

This app holds a secret inside. Can you find it?

Objective: A secret string is hidden somewhere in this binary. Find a way to extract it. The app will give you a hint when started.

- Author: [Bernhard Mueller](https://github.com/b-mueller "Bernhard Mueller")
- Maintained by the OWASP MSTG leaders [Jeroen Willemsen](https://github.com/commjoen "Jeroen Willemsen") & [Sven Schleier](https://github.com/sushi2k "Sven Schleier")

### Installation

Open the "Device" window in Xcode and drag the IPA file into the list below "Installed Apps".

Note: The IPA is signed with an Enterprise distribution certificate. You'll need to install the provisioning profile and trust the developer to run the app the "normal" way. Alternatively, re-sign the app with your own certificate, or run it on a jailbroken device (you'll want to do one of those anyway to crack it).

## [UnCrackable App for iOS Level 2](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/Crackmes/iOS/Level_02/ "iOS level2")

This app holds a secret inside - and this time it won't be tampered with!

- Author: [Bernhard Mueller](https://github.com/b-mueller "Bernhard Mueller")
- Maintained by the OWASP MSTG leaders [Jeroen Willemsen](https://github.com/commjoen "Jeroen Willemsen") & [Sven Schleier](https://github.com/sushi2k "Sven Schleier")

Objective: Find the secret code - it is related to alcoholic beverages.

Note: Due to its anti-tampering the app won't run correctly if the main executable is modified and/or re-signed. You'll need to trust the developer run it the standard way on a non-jailbroken device (General Settings -> Profile & Device Management) and to verify the solution.

### Installation

Open the "Device" window in Xcode and drag the IPA file into the list below "Installed Apps".

Note: The IPA is signed with an Enterprise distribution certificate. You'll need to install the provisioning profile and trust the developer to run the app the "normal" way. Alternatively, re-sign the app with your own certificate, or run it on a jailbroken device (you'll want to do one of those anyway to crack it).

## Issues with the Crackmes

Currently, the code is being maintained by [@commjoen](https://github.com/commjoen "Jeroen Willemsen"). If the app does not boot, or if there is another bug: file an issue at this repository or at [the one you should not go to](https://github.com/commjoen/uncrackable_app "uncrackable_app repo").
